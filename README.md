# Planetary System Simulation 🪐🚀

Welcome to the Planetary System Simulation project! This web application allows you to simulate the trajectories of two planets in a gravitational system.

## Features

🌌 **Simulation Form**: Enter the masses, initial positions, and velocities of two planets.
📈 **Trajectory Prediction**: Calculate the predicted trajectories based on your input.
🎥 **Live Simulation**: View the trajectories interactively with Plotly.

## Technologies Used

🖥️ **Python**: Backend powered by Flask.
🔢 **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array handling.
📊 **Plotly**: To create interactive visualizations of the trajectories.
🌐 **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend user interface.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the Flask application: `python app.py`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## How to Use

1. Enter the masses, initial positions, and velocities of the two planets in the provided form.
2. Click "Predict Trajectory" to simulate and visualize the paths of the planets.
3. Use the interactive plot to observe the planetary movements.
4. Optionally, click "Show Live Simulation" for a dynamic visualization of the trajectories.
